# electronic-component-classification
Repository for detection and classification of electronic components in an electrical circuit

# Possible datasets: 

https://universe.roboflow.com/sarl/electronic-circuits-ifz6c
https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-100/circuit-voltages
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moodrammer/handdrawn-circuit-schematic-components/data




# Notes: 
- Currently the kaggle components dataset needs to be manually copied and pasted into datase/components. This could be solved by using the KaggleApi, but it is a bit cumbersome.
